# HouseSimulator
Estimates the embodied carbon, operational carbon emissions, and cost of a set of house retrofits, defined by wall materials, appliances, and prior-researched data.
Simulates the conduction heat transfer through the walls of a house.

Part of the City of Toronto's net-zero-by-2040 project, specifically, researching low embodied carbon building materials for emission-reducing home retrofits. Written for the University of Toronto's Engineering Studies and Practices II course (APS112).

Unfortunately there is no documentation nor user interface. Perhaps in the future, a easy-to-use tool for homeowners can be made.
